% example 3: Make a function which takes one input variable and two outputs
% suppose we have both (Area of circle and Area of rectangular)

function [A1,A2]=area1(x)
A1 = pi*x^2;          % area of circle
A2 = x*x;             %
end



% [Areaa1, Area2] = area1(6)        --------  Both Arears are visible

% [Areaa1, Area2] = area1(6)        --------  one Arear is visible
